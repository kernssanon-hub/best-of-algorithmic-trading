### For maintainers (TypeScript checks)

This repo includes a small **TypeScript** validator for `projects.yaml` (schema, categories, labels, duplicate IDs). After cloning:

```bash
npm install
npm run check   # compile + validate projects.yaml
```

CI runs the same check on relevant changes. Fixing validation errors before merging keeps the list consistent.
